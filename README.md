# Command Instruction

## Music Commands

### Play Command Usage

The `/play` command now supports both song titles and direct URLs:

#### Supported Formats:

##### 1. Song Title Search
- `/play never gonna give you up`
- `/play imagine dragons believer`
- `/play taylor swift shake it off`

The bot will automatically search YouTube and play the first result.

##### 2. Direct URLs
- **YouTube**: `/play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
- **Spotify**: `/play https://open.spotify.com/track/4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh`
- **SoundCloud**: `/play https://soundcloud.com/artist/track`

#### How it works:
1. If you provide a URL, the bot plays it directly
2. If you provide a song title, the bot:
   - Shows "üîç Searching YouTube..."
   - Uses YouTube Data API to find the best match
   - Plays the found video

#### Requirements:
- You must be in a voice channel
- The bot needs YouTube Data API access (already configured)
- Supports Spotify and SoundCloud links through DisTube plugins

#### Error Handling:
- If no results found: "‚ùå No results found on YouTube for your search"
- If API fails: Falls back to error message with suggestion to use direct URL
- All interaction timeouts are properly handled

### Other Music Commands:
- `/pause` - Pause current song
- `/resume` - Resume paused song
- `/stop` - Stop music and leave voice channel
- `/connect` - Connect bot to your voice channel
- `/disconnect` - Disconnect bot from voice channel

## Moderation Commands

### Mute/Unmute Commands

#### Command Usage:

##### Mute Command:

Make sure your bot has these permissions in Discord:
- ‚úÖ **Moderate Members** (required for timeout/mute)

- ‚úÖ **Use Slash Commands**
- ‚úÖ **View Channels**

#### Permission Requirements:
- Bot's role must be higher than the user being muted
- Bot cannot mute server admins/owners

#### Error Handling & Troubleshooting:

All interaction timeout errors have been fixed with:
- ‚úÖ Proper try-catch blocks around Discord API calls
- ‚úÖ Improved interaction timeout handling
- ‚úÖ Better member fetching using `fetch()` instead of cache
- ‚úÖ Enhanced permission validation
- ‚úÖ Safer interaction responses with state checking

#### Common Issues & Solutions:

##### "Unknown interaction" Error:
‚úÖ **Fixed** - Added proper error handling and interaction state checking

##### "InteractionNotReplied" Error:
‚úÖ **Fixed** - Added checks for interaction state before responding

##### "User not found" Error:
‚úÖ **Fixed** - Now uses `fetch()` instead of cache for better reliability

##### Permission Errors:
- Ensure bot has "Moderate Members" permission
